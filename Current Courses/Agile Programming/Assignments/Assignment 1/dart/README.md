# How to run
## Install Dart
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) > 1.21 as it comes with Dart SDK. Also required for my next assignment submissions.

Or
- Install standalone [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## Run program
Execute `dart main.dart` in a terminal inside this directory.

# Written in
`Dart SDK version: 2.10.4 (stable) (Unknown timestamp) on "linux_x64"`

# Why Dart?
Dart is like Python and Java had a baby, it's nice.
